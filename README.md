# Astro SCSS Skeleton with Dark Mode support

## Project Structure

Standard Astro structure, but SCSS files are split into sub folders. Uses typescript, which is setup to use path alias's for simplicity

### To use this skeleton:

- Clone the git. Delete the `.git` folder then run `git init` to create the git at initial state
- Edit `astro.config.mjs' to contain the correct site url for the project.
- Change the project name in package.json
- Run `pnpm install` or `npm install` to download the required modules

### Styles structure

```
â”œ
â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ base/
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ \_colors.scss
| | â””â”€â”€ \_fonts.scss
| | â””â”€â”€ \_main.scss
| | â””â”€â”€ \_variables.scss
| | â””â”€â”€ global.scss
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ components
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ \_header.scss
| | â””â”€â”€ \_themeSwitch.scss
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ layout
|
```

\_main.scss contains the imports for the colors, fonts and variables files so to reference any of those, in a component/layout scss file, import \_main.scss. Global declarations are to be put in global.scss which is imported in the basehead.astro file, which should be fine to be used in any layout.

Contains a dark / light mode. This is powered via the \_colors.scss, along with script definitions in the ThemeInitial.astro and ThemeSwitch is a button to switch the theme. If not using the button remove the entries for localstorage in ThemeInitial

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal. Use either `npm` or `pnpm`, advisable to use `pnpm`:
